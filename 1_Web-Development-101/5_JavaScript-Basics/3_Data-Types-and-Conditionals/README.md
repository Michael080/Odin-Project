## Assignments
1. Follow the instructions in the README of our javascript-exercises repository to set up your local environment. Once you have forked the repository, cloned it and installed Jest, review each README file prior to completing the following exercises in order:
`01_helloWorld` (This exercise is intentionally very beginner-friendly to ensure that you have everything set up properly!)
`02_addNumbers`
`03_numberChecker`
`04_mathEquations`
`05_joinStrings`

### Install Jest *from `javascript-exercises/README.md`
| *Jest installation: After cloning this repository to your local machine and installing `npm`, go into the newly created directory (`cd javascript-exercises`) and run `npm install`. This will install Jest and set up the testing platform based on our preconfigured settings. (Note: if you get warnings that packages are out of date or contain vulnerabilities, you can safely ignore them for these exercises.)*
