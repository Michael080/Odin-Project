# Assignment
*The official Chrome DevTools docs are quite good:*

- [Devtools overview:](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/) donâ€™t navigate to any other pages linked here; just get familiar with what tools are available in the DevTools, rather than how to use all of them right now.
- [Open Chrome DevTools:](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/) similar to what we went over above, but with some nice extras.
  - `C`, `CTRL` + `SHIFT`  + `C`: access devtools `Elements` panel w/ `inspect element` "activated". *Shortcut can also be used to toggle `inspect element` on/off while devtools is open*. 
  - `J`: access devtools `Console`
  - `I`: access devtools @ previous tab, *this ONLY opens the tab which was previously opened via `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `I`
- [Get Started With Viewing And Changing The DOM:](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom/) skip through any part that uses the JavaScript console.
- [View and change CSS:](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css) be sure to follow along with any interactive instructions!
