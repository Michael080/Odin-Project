**Reading etc,.:**
- [X] Read up on [variables in JavaScript](https://javascript.info/variables#variable-naming) from JavaScript.info.
- [X] This W3Schools lesson on [JavaScript arithmetic](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp) followed by this on [JavaScript numbers](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_numbers.asp), are good introductions to what you can accomplish with numbers in JavaScript.
    - [X] [JavaScript arithmetic](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp)
    - [X] [JavaScript numbers](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_numbers.asp)
- [X] This MDN article on [JavaScript math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Math) covers the same info from a slightly different point of view, while also teaching you how to apply some basic math in JavaScript. There’s much more that you can do with numbers, but this is all you need at the moment.
4. Read through (and code along with!) this article on [JavaScript operators](http://javascript.info/operators). Don’t forget to do the “Tasks” at the bottom of the page! It will give you a pretty good idea of what you can accomplish with numbers (among other things!) in JavaScript.
