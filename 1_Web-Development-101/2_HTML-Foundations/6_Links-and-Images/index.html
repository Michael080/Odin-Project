    <h1>Links & Images</h1>
    <p>Most of this is review but there appears to be a nugget or two worth peeping.</p>
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <h3><code>target</code>
      Attribute</h3>
    <p><code>a</code>
      tag attribute
      <code>target</code>
      spec where link will be opened:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>_blank</code>: opens in new window</li>
      <li><code>_self</code>:opens in same "frame" as it was clicked
        <strong>default</strong></li>
      <li><code>_parent</code>: opens in parent frame</li>
      <li><code>_top</code>: opens in
        <em>the full body</em>
        of the window</li>
      <li><em>framename</em></li>
    </ul>
    <sub>Frames are no longer recommended for use in modern web design due to their limitations and the introduction of
    more flexible layout options in HTML5.
      <strong>It looks like this stuff has been deprecated, it's possible this info
      is irrelevant/out-of-date.</strong></sub>

    <h3>Opening Links in New Tab</h3>
    <p><strong>TLDR;</strong>
      <em>New Tab Security</em>
      For links to be opened in a new tab use both `noopener` & `noreferrer`. Documentation suggest that</p>
    <p>Link to Odin Project about page w/ the following
      <code>rel</code>
      attribute (used to describe relation between
    current page and linked doc) values:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>noopener</code>:<em>
          "... attribute ensures that a link opened in a new tab or window cannot interact with
        or access the original page. Without it, the new page can use JavaScript to manipulate the original page, which
        poses a security risk."
        </em></li>
      <li><code>noreferrer</code>:
        <em>"attribute provides both privacy and security. It prevents the new page from
        knowing where the user came from (hiding the referrer) and also includes the behavior of noopener, preventing
        the new page from accessing the original page."</em></li>
    </ul>
    <sub>The
      <code>rel</code>
      attribute value
      <code>noreferrer</code>
      includes the functionality of
      <code>noopener</code>
      so must be sufficient on its own.
      <strong>These two attributes are solely for security/privacy and are used for
      preventing
        <em>phishing attacks</em>.</strong></sub>
