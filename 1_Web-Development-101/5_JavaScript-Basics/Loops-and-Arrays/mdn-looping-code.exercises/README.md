## Implementing a launch countdown
In this exercise, we want you to print out a simple launch countdown to the output box, from 10 down to Blastoff.

To complete the exercise:

- [ ] Add code to loop from 10 down to 0. We've provided you with an initializer — let i = 10;.
- [ ] For each iteration, create a new paragraph and append it to the  
- [ ] For the different iteration numbers listed below, write code to insert the required text inside the paragraph (you'll need a conditional statement and multiple para.textContent = lines):
- [ ] If the number is 10, print "Countdown 10" to the paragraph.
- [ ] If the number is 0, print "Blast off!" to the paragraph.
- [ ] For any other number, print just the number to the paragraph.
- **Remember to include an iterator!** However, in this example we are counting down after each iteration, not up, so you don't want `i++` — *how do you iterate downwards?*
