# [Loops and Arrays](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-loops-and-arrays)
## Loops
### Exercises:
- [ ] 1. Read [MDN’s Looping Code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code). It’s a longer one, but make sure you tackle the exercises near the bottom of the page.
- [ ] 2. Once again, same info, slightly different context from [JavaScript.info’s “Loops: While and For”](http://javascript.info/while-for). Be sure to do the exercises at the end of the page. You learn best by doing.

## Arrays
### Exercises:
- [ ] 1. This JavaScript Arrays crash course explains an overview of arrays in JavaScript in about 6 minutes.
- [ ] 2. Read through this intro to arrays from JavaScript.info. You do not need to do the exercises at the end of the page.
- [ ] 3. Read through JavaScript.info’s array method guide for a deeper look at some further array methods in JavaScript. Again, you do not need to do the exercises at the end of the page; we will come back to these later.
- [ ] 4. Bookmark MDN’s Array documentation. You do not need to memorize anything here. This is where you’ll find all built-in array properties and methods and their documentation. This will likely be something you regularly revisit as you code and solve problems.
