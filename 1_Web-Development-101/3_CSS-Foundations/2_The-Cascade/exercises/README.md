# [Cascade Fix Exercise](https://github.com/Michael080/css-exercises)
>[!note] This exercise is from a repo of many exercises originally cloned from [this repo](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises/tree/main)

## Symlinks
Because the **Foundations Exercises** are from a forked repo, and I don't want to deal w/ the complications of nested `git` repos, the directory is soft linked from `/home/alias/Documents/projects-n-courses/css-exercises/foundations/cascade/01-cascade-fix`.
