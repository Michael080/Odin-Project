# Assignment
*The official Chrome DevTools docs are quite good:*

- [Devtools overview:](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/) donâ€™t navigate to any other pages linked here; just get familiar with what tools are available in the DevTools, rather than how to use all of them right now.
- [Open Chrome DevTools:](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/) similar to what we went over above, but with some nice extras.
- [Get Started With Viewing And Changing The DOM:](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom/) skip through any part that uses the JavaScript console.
- [View and change CSS:](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css) be sure to follow along with any interactive instructions!
