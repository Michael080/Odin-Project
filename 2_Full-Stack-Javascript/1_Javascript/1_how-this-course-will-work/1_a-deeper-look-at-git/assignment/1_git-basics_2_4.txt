#---- Undoing Things ----

To fix a previous commit that has NOT yet been pushed:

$ git commit --amend

This will effectively replace the previous commit, and will
not show up in the commit history. This will not work for
commits that have already been pushed upstream though.


#---- Unstaging a Staged File ----

Ex:
Staged -
temp1.txt
temp2.txt

$ git status => (right below  “Changes to be committed”)
    use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage (per Pro Git) ||
    use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage (my terminal says)

* git restore is intended to replace functionality of git reset in
  future versions of git


#---- Unmodifying a Modified File ----
             
To revert a file back to state of previous commit:

$ git status => (right below  “Changes to be committed”)
    (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

$ git checkout -- 'myFile.txt' => reverts to previous state    


#---- Unmodifying a Modified Files w/ git restore ----

Revert file to state of previous commit:

$ git status => (right below  “Changes to be committed”)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
